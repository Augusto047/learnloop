# LearnLoop 📚✨  

## 🚀 Project Overview 
LearnLoop is an intelligent platform that helps learners explain, teach, and reinforce knowledge using **AI-driven peer learning loops**.  
Instead of just consuming content, students **teach back what they learned** — making learning stick 3x faster.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
- 🤖 **AI Mentor** – generates quizzes, flashcards, and personalized feedback.  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Peer Teaching** – students record short explanations and receive instant AI-driven suggestions.  
- 📊 **Progress Dashboard** – visualizes mastery and identifies weak points.  
- 🌍 **Inclusive Access** – lightweight, mobile-first, optimized for low-bandwidth environments.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (prototype in this repo)  
- Backend (planned): Python (FastAPI) + OpenAI API  
- Deployment: GitHub Pages / Vercel  
- AI Models: GPT-powered text + embeddings  

## 🎥 Demo Script  
**Problem:** Students forget 80% of what they learn within 2 weeks.  
**Solution:** LearnLoop turns learners into teachers with AI support.  
**Demo:** Quick tour of AI mentor, peer loop, and progress dashboard.  
**Vision:** 1 million African students empowered by 2028.
